# Iris Dataset Overview

The **Iris Dataset** is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, frequently used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. It contains 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*.

## Features

Each sample has four distinct features, measured in centimeters:
- **Sepal Length (SepalLengthCm)**
- **Sepal Width (SepalWidthCm)**
- **Petal Length (PetalLengthCm)**
- **Petal Width (PetalWidthCm)**

## Target Variable
- **Species**: The flower species, which is the target class with three possible values (*setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica*).

## Use Cases

This dataset is ideal for:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning (classification tasks)
- Statistical analysis and visualization

The Iris dataset is small, clean, and well-structured, making it a go-to resource for beginners and experts alike.
