Further, a brief introduction to all the services in Vertex AI is provided section-wise.

## Tools:
### Model Garden: 
Model Garden in Vertex AI is a feature within Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform that offers a curated collection of pre-trained and fine-tunable machine learning and language models. These models are designed to help developers and data scientists accelerate their AI/ML projects by providing ready-to-use models for various tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more. You can filter these models by modalities( artifact format), providers and the features models support. Keep in mind while testing LLM’s might not be expensive, deploying few closed models is a lot more expensive usually few thousand dollars per month. Always be sure to check the price before deploying LLM.

## Pipelines: 
Vertex AI Pipelines lets you automate, monitor, and govern your machine learning (ML) systems in a serverless manner by using ML pipelines to orchestrate your ML workflows. You can batch-run ML pipelines defined using the Kubeflow Pipelines or the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) framework. To learn how to choose a framework for defining your ML pipeline, see Interfaces to define a pipeline.

You can build pipelines in Kubeflow and migrate the files to Vertex AI pipelines. The key difference between the 2 is how they handle storage. Kubeflow uses Kubernetes resources whereas Vertex AI uses cloud storage.

You can create custom pipelines, use default templates from the template gallery, or upload YAML / XML pipeline files. To run the pipeline you have to give a place to store the outputs of the particular pipeline, usually cloud storage in GCP for this case.

Unfortunately, you can’t access all features on your free google account. Tuning and Advanced parameter features are available if you upgrade your free-trial account to standard billing account.

Vertex AI studio prompt categories:
From the Vertex AI Studio you can test and customize prompts for different generative AI models.
- Freeform: Test text and multimodal prompts using a variety of models. To learn about the models, see Gemini models.
- Chat: Try out multi-turn prompts using a variety of language models. To learn about the models, see Gemini models.
- Translation: Perform translation.
- Vision: Test image model generation using Imagen on Vertex AI.
- Speech: Perform text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions. This is done using the Chirp model. To learn more about Chirp, see Chirp: Universal speech model.




Tuning (fine-tuning): This is one of the ways to enhance LLM responses, usually works best when you have large labelled data. Resource-extensive method, considered after prompt engineering and RAG. Approaches like Parameter-efficient-finetuning and Full-finetuning are available in tuning features. Vertex AI Agent Builder is something to look into if you’re building LLM applications.

## Data
### Feature Store
Vertex AI Feature Store is a managed, cloud-native feature store service that's integral to Vertex AI. It streamlines your ML feature management and online serving processes by letting you manage your feature data in a BigQuery table or view. You can then serve features online directly from the BigQuery data source.

The workflow to set up and start online serving using Vertex AI Feature Store can be summarized as follows:

- Prepare your data source in BigQuery.

- Optional: Register your data sources by creating feature groups and features.

- Set up online store and feature view resources to connect the feature data sources with online serving clusters.

- Serve the latest feature values online from a feature view.

### Datasets
You can use a managed dataset to provide the source data used to train AutoML and custom models on Vertex AI. A managed dataset is required for AutoML and is optional for custom training.
You can create managed datasets for training AutoML models by using the Google Cloud console or the Vertex AI API. The instructions for how to do this slightly vary based on your data type and model objective. Start by preparing your training data.

## Model Development

### Training:

#### Train and use your own models
**AutoML**: Create and train models with minimal technical knowledge and effort. To learn more about AutoML, see [AutoML beginner's guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide).
  
**Custom training**: Create and train models at scale using any ML framework. To learn more about custom training on Vertex AI, see [Custom training overview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/overview).

![Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 3 08 21 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdc8f33-15b5-4291-85cb-36a278bc408f)

**AutoML**:  
  
Machine learning (ML) models use training data to learn how to infer results for data that the model was not trained on. AutoML on Vertex AI lets you build a code-free model based on the training data that you provide.
The workflow for training and using an AutoML model is the same, regardless of your datatype or objective:

1. Prepare your training data.
2. Create a dataset.
3. Train a model.
4. Evaluate and iterate on your model.
5. Get predictions from your model.
6. Interpret prediction results.

**Custom training**:

If none of the AutoML solutions address your needs, you can also create your own training application and use it to train custom models on Vertex AI. You can use any ML framework that you want and configure the compute resources to use for training, including the following:

1. Type and number of VMs.
2. Graphics processing units (GPUs).
3. Tensor processing units (TPUs).
4. Type and size of boot disk.

### Experiment:
Vertex AI Experiments is a tool that helps you track and analyze different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training environments, letting you track the steps, inputs, and outputs of an experiment run. Vertex AI Experiments can also evaluate how your model performed in aggregate, against test datasets, and during the training run. You can then use this information to select the best model for your particular use case.

### Metadata:
Metadata helps you:
1. Analyze runs of a production ML system to understand changes in the quality of predictions.
2. Analyze ML experiments to compare the effectiveness of different sets of hyperparameters.
3. Track the lineage of ML artifacts, for example datasets and models, to understand just what contributed to the creation of an artifact or how that artifact was used to create descendant artifacts.
4. Rerun an ML workflow with the same artifacts and parameters.
5. Track the downstream usage of ML artifacts for governance purposes.



## Deploy and Use


#### Deploy a model to an endpoint: 

You must deploy a model to an endpoint before that model can be used to serve online predictions. 
When you deploy a model using the Vertex AI API, you complete the following steps:

1. Create an endpoint if needed.
2. Get the endpoint ID.
3. Deploy the model to the endpoint.

![Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 3 12 49 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d412fa-c7cb-4d34-8f27-f9b0c57cc8a9)

#### Getting predictions on Vertex AI: 

A prediction is the output of a trained machine learning model.

**Vertex AI offers two methods for getting prediction:**

**Online predictions** are synchronous requests made to a model that is deployed to an endpoint. Therefore, before sending a request, you must first deploy the Model resource to an endpoint. This associates compute resources with the model so that it can serve online predictions with low latency. Use online predictions when you are making requests in response to application input or in situations that require timely inference.

**Batch predictions** are asynchronous requests made to a model that isn't deployed to an endpoint. You send the request directly to the Model resource. Use batch predictions when you don't require an immediate response and want to process accumulated data by using a single request.

#### Monitoring:
Vertex AI Model Monitoring lets you run monitoring jobs as needed or on a regular schedule to track the quality of your tabular models. If you've set alerts, Vertex AI Model Monitoring informs you when metrics surpass a specified threshold.
